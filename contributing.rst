Contributing to Open Civic Data
===============================

We welcome everyone interested in contributing.  In general it is a good idea
to reach out to us, either via `Slack <https://ocd-slack-invite-automation.herokuapp.com/>`_
or by filing an issue on the appropriate repository.

Below is a general guide to help you figure out where to get started depending
on your interest.

Writing Scrapers
================

The lowest barrier to entry is in contributing a new scraper.  Different types of
government are maintained by different teams and in different repos.

The three most active are:

`scrapers-us-municipal <https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal>`_
    Scrapers for municipal governments in the US.

`scrapers-ca <https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-ca>`_
    Scrapers for Canadian governments.

`openstates <https://github.com/openstates/openstates>`_
    Scrapers for US state legislatures.
    

Improving the Documentation
============================

The docs you're currently reading are maintained at `docs.opencivicdata.org <https://github.com/opencivicdata/docs.opencivicdata.org>`_.


Expanding the Universe of Division Identifiers
===============================================

On GitHub, you'll find the following projects:

`ocd-division-ids <https://github.com/opencivicdata/ocd-division-ids>`_
    A repository supporting the :ref:`division-id` initiative.  Functions as the canonical list of all
    Open Civic Data Division Identifiers.
