Open Civic Data
===============

The `opencivicdata <https://github.com/opencivicdata/>`_ organization on GitHub 
is the home to a collaborative effort to define common schemas and provide 
tools for gathering & standardizing government data.

Currently the project provides these schemas and tooling for data related to
the composition and working of legislatures.  Additional efforts are underway
to extend the modeling to include electoral and campaign finance information.

Most discussion around the project takes place either on the GitHub organization
or on our `Open Civic Data Slack <https://ocd-slack-invite-automation.herokuapp.com/>`_.
